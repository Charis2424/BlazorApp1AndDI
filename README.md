This repository contains my first attempt at using Blazor along with dependency injection (DI) to test various DI instances. I've explored transient, scoped, and singleton services, as well as instances of singleton services. The code demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and display it in a Blazor component, showcasing the use of dynamic objects and JSON deserialization. Additionally, it includes examples of accessing and displaying specific properties from JSON data within the Blazor component. This project serves as a learning exercise for understanding Blazor concepts and dependency injection in .NET applications."
